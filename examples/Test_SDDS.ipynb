Despite efforts to employ nonlinguistic tasks in these studies, the interdependency of the cognitive systems supporting working memory, attention, and language processing makes it difficult to rule out entirely explanations related to the language deficit in SLI. Another concern arising from these studies relates to the potential discrepancy in the cognitive load imposed by the tasks on children with and without impairments. Even in cases where children with impairments perform accurately, the cognitive load of the task may be higher, requiring the recruitment of additional or alternate resources. The current study provided a systematic examination of the relationship among working memory skills, language abilities, and cognitive functioning by examining whether performance on a selective attention task imposing varying but individually adjusted memory demands is dependent on working memory and/or language abilities in children with and without impairments.',\n",

In Cowan and colleagues’ study, an array of different colored items was presented, including either one shape (i.e., all circles) or two shapes (i.e., circles and triangles), followed by an array including a single shape. Participants were instructed to attend to one shape only (e.g., the circles) and to decide whether the shape in the second array was identical to the one that had been in the same location in the previous array. Attention was manipulated by including one shape (all target shapes) or two shapes (target plus distractor shapes) such that if distractor shapes could be ignored, fewer items would need to be retained in memory. Working memory load was manipulated by varying the number of total shapes in the array. A disproportionate attention-related effect was found for the young group relative to both the older child and adult groups under conditions of high working memory load (six items in an array) but not low working memory load (four items). The results were suggested to indicate that a fundamental storage capacity difference accounts for the developmental increase in working memory capacity and that attentional control was present in young children provided that working memory load was minimized.

The reasoning was that the cost of additional attentional control would not exceed working memory capacity in the low load condition, resulting in no performance decrement, whereas the cost would exceed working memory capacity in the high load condition, impairing recall accuracy. A second aim was to evaluate whether general working memory capacity or language ability measures were related to the processing time or accuracy of responses. We expected an interaction between measures of working memory capacity and performance on our selective attention task. An attention-related advantage was expected for individuals with high working memory capacity over those with low working memory capacity given their greater available resources.

As well, general working memory but not language abilities were positively related to overall accuracy on the experimental selective attention task regardless of the load, selective attention requirements, or span length at which the task was completed. Differences in response times based on task load and selective attention requirements were influenced by an individual’s storage capacity. For those with short spans, response time was faster under low load conditions and faster when 2 shapes were present. Those with long spans, however, were relatively impervious to the load and attention manipulation, showing no systematic difference in response time when working above or within span or when viewing 1 or 2 shapes. Language abilities but not general working memory skills were related to response times on the task in somewhat complex ways.

Conversely, when the total number of items presented exceeded the individual’s storage capacity such that the working memory load imposed was high, there was a selective attention cost, resulting in less accurate performance. The interpretation here is quite clear. When working below span, sufficient resources were available to do the task regardless of whether distractor shapes were present or not. When working above span, however, sufficient resources were not available, resulting in impaired filtering. As a result, irrelevant items could not be filtered out, leading participants to attempt to retain both target and distractor shapes. Notice that the argument is not simply that efforts to filter were abandoned, which would render the 1 shape–above span and 2 shapes–above span conditions equal in terms of the total number of items to be retained. Rather, the reduced accuracy in the above span–2 shapes condition indicates an attention-related cost.

As with our findings, filtering was impaired when working above span for the youngest group in Cowan and colleagues’ study and more generally in our study. It could be argued that the lack of an attention-related cost in the older groups in Cowan and colleagues’ study was due to the design not including above span arrays for these groups. The maximum array administered by Cowan and colleagues had 6 items, which was lower than the average span of the children in the current study. It might also be the case that the individually adjusted span lengths corresponding to high and low working memory load in the current study more clearly revealed the costs of selective attention demands when working above span.

Although not directly tested in the current study, a more likely explanation is that these differences arise due to strategy use. It is possible that short span individuals are less efficient at refreshing memory, in using rehearsal strategies, or in allocating attention, leading to slower performance under conditions taxing available resources.

It might take more time for long span individuals with weaker language skills to encode, rehearse, or retrieve items from memory due to less efficient use of verbal self-cues.',\n",

None of the differences related to language abilities resulted in reduced performance accuracy on our task even though those with poor language skills made slower responses in some cases. Nevertheless, it might be that the demands of our task were too simple and short-lived for the slower response times to affect performance. Over multiple steps completed slowly, those with poor language skills could fail to compete tasks as expected. The finding that language abilities were related to response time and not accuracy is more consistent with theories of SLI implicating generalized slowing in information processing (',\n",

Nevertheless, the current results do not provide strong support for a generalized slowing account; children with poor language in the current study were not slower to respond than their peers. It was their peers who were faster to respond under low load conditions. On the other hand, our study did not provide a rigorous test of a generalized slowing account for SLI either. We measured response time. Many previous studies demonstrating slower responses in SLI than typically developing groups have employed reaction time paradigms that more directly test the fastest possible response after presentation of a stimulus (',\n",

One way that we attempted to combat this issue was to recruit participants with a broad range of language and working memory abilities. The resulting problem was an unbalanced design such that many more participants met criteria for typical development than language impairment or working memory impairment. To deal with this, we analyzed the data using linear mixed effects, a procedure that can accommodate both unbalanced designs and correlated observations. It could be argued that not having all participants complete the identical task with the same number of items is a limitation. Nevertheless, we had a strong rationale for adjusting task demands based on individual storage capacity. As a result, we argue that the high/low working memory load manipulation employed imposed uniformly high or low demands for all participants. Finally, the generalized measures of working memory and language included in the current study were administered up to 8 months prior to the experimental task. Given that the standardized tests employed used 12-month age bands for all ages tested and the age range of the participants (6–10',\n",

First and foremost, the findings highlight the vulnerability of working above span, especially for those with low storage capacities. Cognitive demands were additive in the current study such that attention-related and storage-related requirements affected working memory performance. Importantly, even attempts to help a child through a task may do nothing but add additional, and unachievable, demands when the child is working beyond his or her working memory storage capacity. In our study, the effort to direct attention to the important information used up precious resources and resulted in lower recall accuracy when working above span. Speed of responding to varying cognitive loads was associated with language abilities in the current study. Those with good language skills were able to respond faster when cognitive load was low.

The ability to selectively attend to target shapes depended on whether the task was being completed above or below span. When working within available storage capacity, selective attention demands had no impact on performance, whereas when working beyond available storage capacity, there was a cost due to the inability to filter out irrelevant items and the associated effort. Another novel finding was related to the impact on response times of working beyond available short-term memory capacity. Those with high storage capacity were relatively impervious to above span demands, maintaining performance response times despite the increased load. On the other hand, high load imposed a cost on those with low storage capacity, resulting in slower responses. There was a positive overall relationship between the experimental task and a generalized working memory measure, suggesting that the impact of attention-related and storage demands are additive with no preferential access to available resources.

The current study systematically examined the relationship among executive attention, working memory executive skills, and language abilities while adjusting for individual differences in short-term memory. School-age children completed a selective attention task requiring them to recall whether a presented shape was in the same place as a previous target shape shown in an array imposing a low or high working memory load. Results revealed a selective attention cost when working above but not within memory span capacity. Measures of general working memory were positively related to overall task performance, whereas language abilities were related to response time. In particular, higher language skills were associated with faster responses under low load conditions. These findings suggest that attentional control and storage demands have an additive impact on working memory resources but provide only limited evidence for a domain-general mechanism in language learning.',\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Attention allocation, updating working memory, and language processing are interdependent cognitive tasks related to the focused direction of limited resources, refreshing and substituting information in the current focus of attention, and receiving/sending verbal communication, respectively. These systems are probably impossible to study in isolation, which makes interpretation of findings related to any one of them challenging. For example, we know that children with an unexpected and disproportionate impairment in language development known as specific language impairment (SLI) show deficits relative to age-matched peers on measures of attention ([Finneran, Francis, & Leonard, 2009) and working memory ([Archibald & Gathercole, 2007). Despite efforts to employ nonlinguistic tasks in these studies, the interdependency of the cognitive systems supporting working memory, attention, and language processing makes it difficult to rule out entirely explanations related to the language deficit in SLI. Another concern arising from these studies relates to the potential discrepancy in the cognitive load imposed by the tasks on children with and without impairments. Even in cases where children with impairments perform accurately, the cognitive load of the task may be higher, requiring the recruitment of additional or alternate resources. The current study provided a systematic examination of the relationship among working memory skills, language abilities, and cognitive functioning by examining whether performance on a selective attention task imposing varying but individually adjusted memory demands is dependent on working memory and/or language abilities in children with and without impairments.\n",
      "Attention is viewed as a limited capacity system (e.g.,[Kahneman, 1973; Lavie, 2005; Lavie, Hirst, de Fockert, & Viding, 2004) that consists of multiple components, including the ability to focus, sustain, and switch mental focus ([Parasuraman & Davies, 1984; Posner, 1978; Shiffrin, 1988). Essentially, in functional terms, attention refers to the ability to selectively process information, a critical aspect of our cognitive capacities ([Fougnie, 2008). Attentional functions performed by distinct networks include alerting to achieve a general state of responsiveness to sensory stimulation, orienting to a subset of sensory information for privileged processing, and executive attention acting on post-sensory representations when competition exists for access to a central, limited-capacity system ([Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz, & Posner, 2002; Posner & Petersen, 1990). Executive attention is considered a domain-general resource shared broadly in post-perceptual cognitive tasks such as those under study in the current work.\n",
      "Another critical aspect of our cognitive capacities is working memory, the ability to retain task-relevant information in a highly activated and accessible state over time ([Hambrick, Kane, & Engle, 2005; Kane & Engle, 2002). One key component of working memory is a controlled attentional resource responsible for the coordination of storage and processing within working memory ([Bayliss, Jarrold, Gunn, & Baddeley, 2003; Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999; Kane et al., 2004). There is clearly a role for the executive attentional resource described above in the notion of a controlled attentional resource or “central executive” ([Baddeley & Hitch, 1974) in working memory. Indeed, many studies have demonstrated the close relationship between attention and working memory ([Bleckley, Durso, Crutchfield, Engle, & Khanna, 2003; Martinussen, Hayden, Hogg-Johnson, & Tannock, 2005; Vogel, McCollough, & Machizawa, 2005).\n",
      "Nevertheless, the constructs of executive attention and the central executive of working memory are not entirely isomorphic. The central executive of working memory is a broader concept incorporating responsibility for the monitoring of ongoing cognitive processes and actions, the selective activation of relevant representations and procedures, and the suppression of irrelevant, distracting ones ([Oberauer, Süβ, Wilhelm, & Wittman, 2003). Beyond the theoretical distinctions, however, it is challenging to empirically demonstrate the unique contributions of executive attention and central executive/working memory processes. In one study of healthy adults, the best model of the data included both attention and working memory as separate predictors of intelligence ([Schweizer & Moosbrugger, 2004). In the current study, we further examined the relationship between attention and working memory by having participants complete a selective attention task under different working memory loads while individually equating the demands of another component of working memory, short-term storage.\n",
      "The operation of the central executive of working memory on relevant stimuli necessitates the retention of those stimuli in an accessible state. These basic memory abilities are the second main component of working memory and are conceived of as short-term memory stores ([Baddeley & Hitch, 1974) or a functional store composed of an activated subset of information held in long-term memory ([Cowan, 1999). It is generally agreed that there is some domain specificity in the short-term storage of information. According to one of the most prominent working memory models ([Baddeley, 1986; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974), distinct phonological and visuospatial short-term memory stores support retention. Other models account for domain specificity in working memory by allowing for interference between similar representations ([Cowan, 1999) and the influence of domain-specific cognitive operations such as verbal rehearsal and chunking of spatial patterns ([Oberauer et al., 2003).\n",
      "There is now considerable evidence that working memory involves some resource sharing; that is, there is some trade-off between the storage and processing demands of working memory tasks ([Barrouillet, Bernardin, & Camos, 2004). According to these accounts, controlled attentional resources shift from the processing demands of the task to the refreshing or rehearsal of the material in storage ([Barrouillet et al., 2004; Case, Kurland, & Goldberg, 1982; Towse & Hitch, 1995). It follows from this that individual differences, both in the capacity for storage and in controlled attention, constrain performance. To focus on the controlled attentional resource in working memory in the current study, we employed a novel approach involving equating storage demands across individuals.\n",
      "Language processing is a broad term encompassing the complex computational knowledge base required to send and receive verbal messages using phonological, mophosyntactic, semantic, and other conventions. Language learning places high demands on domain-general information processing abilities; language stimuli must be quickly encoded and retained, placing a load on the speed or capacity of online processing resources. Consistent with this view, current language processing theories incorporate domain-general mechanisms. For example, recent language acquisition theories include a domain-general statistical or probabilistic learning mechanism ([Saffran, 2003). As well, all sentence parsing models include a limited-capacity memory constraint characteristic of general cognition ([Kelly & Martin, 1994).\n",
      "It has been suggested that working memory supports language learning ([Baddeley, 2003). Ample evidence links working memory to language comprehension and expression in first language learners ([Gilchrist, Cowan, & Naveh-Benjamin, 2008; King & Just, 1991) and second language learners ([Andersson, 2010; Martin & Ellis, 2012). Findings of a relationship between language performance and verbal working memory measures, however, do not clearly demonstrate a role of working memory in supporting language learning. Indeed, researchers have argued that all of these tasks tap a single language processing resource ([Caplan & Waters, 1999; MacDonald & Christiansen, 2002). Evidence of a relationship between language abilities and a domain-general working memory component would be strengthened by findings of links between language performance and nonlinguistic working memory tasks, as investigated in the current study. It is important to remember the multiple components of working memory here and that the short-term storage component is considered domain specific. Many studies have demonstrated strong links between measures of phonological processing and language abilities ([Coady, 2013; Gathercole, 2006; Vandewalle, Boets, Ghesquière, & Zink, 2012). It follows from this that individual differences in domain-specific storage capacity could account for the previously established links between language and working memory. To focus on the relationship between language performance and domain-general central executive or executive attention processes, storage demands must be equated across participants as in the current study.\n",
      "One additional line of evidence for the relationship among attention, working memory, and language processing comes from children with impairments. Children with SLI have a disproportionate impairment in language learning. Nevertheless, nonlinguistic deficits in children who meet criteria for SLI are commonly reported ([Gallinat & Spaulding, 2012). Indeed, lower performance by SLI groups relative to age-matched typically developing groups has been found for measures of attention ([Finneran et al., 2009), working memory ([Archibald & Gathercole, 2007), and processing speed ([Miller, Kail, Leonard, & Tomblin, 2001). Such findings have led to the suggestion that a domain-general impairment in information processing speed ([Kail, 1994) or capacity ([Bishop, 1992) underlies SLI. Once again, however, examining the relationships between language and cognitive functioning is challenged by the overlap in task demands often tapping each of these systems. In one of the first studies to systematically differentiate children with language impairments with or without working memory impairments,[Noonan, Redmond, and Archibald (2014) demonstrated unique impacts on grammaticality judgment of these separable impairments. The findings are important because they highlight the interdependency of the systems but provide evidence against a causal connection between a working memory impairment and SLI. Consistent with this notion, poorer scores have been found for children with attention deficit disorders relative to age-matched peers on measures of language even though many of these children do not meet criteria for SLI ([Redmond, 2005; Redmond, Thompson, & Goldstein, 2011).\n",
      "The aim of the current study was to systematically examine the relationship among executive attention, working memory executive skills, and language abilities with short-term memory demands individually adjusted across participants. To do this, we adapted a procedure employed by Cowan and colleagues ([Cowan, Morey, AuBuchon, Zwilling, & Gilchrist, 2010) to investigate whether executive attention or storage capacity accounted for the developmental increase in working memory across three groups: young children aged 6 or 7years, older children aged 12 or 13years, and adults. In Cowan and colleagues’ study, an array of different colored items was presented, including either one shape (i.e., all circles) or two shapes (i.e., circles and triangles), followed by an array including a single shape. Participants were instructed to attend to one shape only (e.g., the circles) and to decide whether the shape in the second array was identical to the one that had been in the same location in the previous array. Attention was manipulated by including one shape (all target shapes) or two shapes (target plus distractor shapes) such that if distractor shapes could be ignored, fewer items would need to be retained in memory. Working memory load was manipulated by varying the number of total shapes in the array. A disproportionate attention-related effect was found for the young group relative to both the older child and adult groups under conditions of high working memory load (six items in an array) but not low working memory load (four items). The results were suggested to indicate that a fundamental storage capacity difference accounts for the developmental increase in working memory capacity and that attentional control was present in young children provided that working memory load was minimized. These findings further underscore the need to adjust storage demands based on individual short-term memory capacity as in the current study.\n",
      "In the current study, school-age children completed a selective attention task under individually determined high or low working memory load conditions following[Cowan and colleagues (2010) as well as measures of working memory capacity and language abilities. The first goal was to examine the interaction between selective attention and working memory load. A cost of the attention manipulation was expected in the high working memory condition but not in the low working memory condition. The reasoning was that the cost of additional attentional control would not exceed working memory capacity in the low load condition, resulting in no performance decrement, whereas the cost would exceed working memory capacity in the high load condition, impairing recall accuracy. A second aim was to evaluate whether general working memory capacity or language ability measures were related to the processing time or accuracy of responses. We expected an interaction between measures of working memory capacity and performance on our selective attention task. An attention-related advantage was expected for individuals with high working memory capacity over those with low working memory capacity given their greater available resources. No predictive hypothesis was established regarding language abilities. The role of a domain-general mechanism related to attention or working memory in language learning would be supported by results indicating a relationship between our measures of language abilities and our nonlinguistic selective attention/working memory task.\n",

      "Discussion\n",
      "The current study systematically examined the relationships among selective attention, working memory, and language abilities in school-age children. Performance accuracy differences were evident when selective attention was required, resulting in a cost under conditions of high working memory load but not low working memory load. As well, general working memory but not language abilities were positively related to overall accuracy on the experimental selective attention task regardless of the load, selective attention requirements, or span length at which the task was completed. Differences in response times based on task load and selective attention requirements were influenced by an individual’s storage capacity. For those with short spans, response time was faster under low load conditions and faster when 2 shapes were present. Those with long spans, however, were relatively impervious to the load and attention manipulation, showing no systematic difference in response time when working above or within span or when viewing 1 or 2 shapes. Language abilities but not general working memory skills were related to response times on the task in somewhat complex ways. Generally speaking, those with lower language scores completed the task more slowly, a difference that was particularly marked for those with long spans.\n",
      "First, consider the results related to demands for selective attention. When the total number of items presented was within the individual’s storage capacity such that the working memory load imposed was low, the requirements for selective attention had no significant impact on performance accuracy. Conversely, when the total number of items presented exceeded the individual’s storage capacity such that the working memory load imposed was high, there was a selective attention cost, resulting in less accurate performance. The interpretation here is quite clear. When working below span, sufficient resources were available to do the task regardless of whether distractor shapes were present or not. When working above span, however, sufficient resources were not available, resulting in impaired filtering. As a result, irrelevant items could not be filtered out, leading participants to attempt to retain both target and distractor shapes. Notice that the argument is not simply that efforts to filter were abandoned, which would render the 1 shape–above span and 2 shapes–above span conditions equal in terms of the total number of items to be retained. Rather, the reduced accuracy in the above span–2 shapes condition indicates an attention-related cost. The effort of trying to filter out irrelevant items in conjunction with insufficient memory resources resulted in impaired attentional control.\n",
      "These findings are consistent with those reported by[Cowan and colleagues (2010) using a similar paradigm. In their study, no group differences between their young children (6 or 7years), older children (11 or 12years), and adults were observed when completing their selective attention task on small arrays (4 items), whereas significantly lower scores were found for the young group only on larger arrays (6 items). As with our findings, filtering was impaired when working above span for the youngest group in Cowan and colleagues’ study and more generally in our study. It could be argued that the lack of an attention-related cost in the older groups in Cowan and colleagues’ study was due to the design not including above span arrays for these groups. The maximum array administered by Cowan and colleagues had 6 items, which was lower than the average span of the children in the current study. It might also be the case that the individually adjusted span lengths corresponding to high and low working memory load in the current study more clearly revealed the costs of selective attention demands when working above span. Our findings provide clear evidence of an interaction between executive attention and working memory load such that attentional costs occur only when load is high. Even efforts to simplify a task by directing attention to relevant items may place an added burden if the working memory load of the task exceeds available resources.\n",
      "It is not particularly surprising that our general working memory measure was positively related to overall accuracy on our selective attention/working memory task. What is possibly surprising, however, is that no interaction occurred between general working memory and our attention-related task manipulation. The results suggest that there is an overall additive impact of resource demands on working memory performance. Many studies have been aimed at identifying unique cognitive constraints on working memory, including attention ([Cowan et al., 2010; Unsworth & Spillers, 2010), storage capacity ([Cowan et al., 2010; Unsworth & Spillers, 2010), and long-term knowledge ([Gathercole, 2006). The current findings, however, suggest that all of these factors (and others we have yet to identify) place a summative load on available resources. This notion is clearly consistent with resource-sharing accounts of working memory ([Barrouillet et al., 2004; Towse & Hitch, 1995) proposing that controlled attentional resources shift to meet the different demands of the task. Extending this, our results suggest no preferential access to available resources such that demands for selective attention do not take precedence over storage requirements or vice versa.\n",
      "Another important finding in the current study is that storage capacity influenced response times even when array sizes were individually adjusted according to each participant’s span length. In particular, our results reveal unique relationships between storage capacity and response to working memory load independent of attention. Specifically, long span individuals showed similar response times regardless of whether task demands differed in terms of attention or load. Short span individuals, on the other hand, made faster responses under low load conditions than under high load conditions. Importantly, these differences cannot be attributed to a selective attention deficit in short span individuals, as evidenced by the lack of an interaction between the number of shapes presented and span length in the accuracy data and the faster response times to 2 shapes as span decreased.\n",
      "The slower response times under high load conditions for short span individuals but not long span individuals suggests a cost for short span individuals in working under conditions that tax available resources, costs not evident in those with long spans. Although there was no impact on accuracy in our simple task requiring recall over a couple of seconds, the slower response times suggest that the short span individuals are less adept at working above their capacity. Why would this be so? One possibility could be that the demands of the high working memory load condition were greater for our short span individuals than for our long span individuals. Such an argument could apply if we had imposed one common high working memory load for all participants as has been done in many previous studies ([Cowan et al., 2010). If this were the case, some of our participants would have been working very much beyond their span and others possibly not. The design of the current study, however, essentially rules out explanations related to working memory load because we titrated load to each individual’s storage capacity. The load of the above span condition was similar across all participants. Although not directly tested in the current study, a more likely explanation is that these differences arise due to strategy use. It is possible that short span individuals are less efficient at refreshing memory, in using rehearsal strategies, or in allocating attention, leading to slower performance under conditions taxing available resources. Perhaps the most likely explanation, however, is suggested by the remarkable consistency in the performance of our long span individuals. These results suggest that long span individuals are particularly skilled at efficiently using strategies to manage a variety of task demands.\n",
      "One final question addressed in the current study was whether there was any evidence that language abilities were related to domain-general executive attention and working memory resources. The findings regarding performance accuracy provided no evidence for such a relationship. For response time, however, there was a complex interaction among language abilities, load, and span. Consider first the interaction between language abilities and load. There was no evidence of an overall slowing relative to typical language development by those with low language, a finding that would have been consistent with a general slowing account of SLI ([Kail, 1994). In fact, it was the relative impact of working above or within storage capacity that mattered. Faster responses under low load conditions were observed for those with typically developing good to strong language skills but not for those with low language abilities. Thus, poor language was associated with a relative failure to benefit from low load conditions.\n",
      "The relationship among language abilities, working memory load, and response time was also influenced by individuals’ span length. The most marked effect was for those with high storage capacity (spans of 8 or 9 items), which included one child who met the criterion for a language impairment; language abilities were inversely related to response time such that those with relatively poor language made slower responses regardless of working memory load. One possible explanation for this pattern could be related to the argument regarding strategy use made above. Individuals with long spans who have strong language skills may be particularly adept at employing strategies to assist them in managing the cognitive demands of a task. It might take more time for long span individuals with weaker language skills to encode, rehearse, or retrieve items from memory due to less efficient use of verbal self-cues.\n",
      "Consistent with many language processing theories ([Kelly & Martin, 1994; Saffran, 2003), the current findings demonstrate a relationship between domain-general capacity-limited cognitive functioning and language abilities, albeit only in relation to response time. None of the differences related to language abilities resulted in reduced performance accuracy on our task even though those with poor language skills made slower responses in some cases. Nevertheless, it might be that the demands of our task were too simple and short-lived for the slower response times to affect performance. Over multiple steps completed slowly, those with poor language skills could fail to compete tasks as expected. The finding that language abilities were related to response time and not accuracy is more consistent with theories of SLI implicating generalized slowing in information processing ([Kail, 1994) than reduced capacity ([Bishop, 1992). Nevertheless, the current results do not provide strong support for a generalized slowing account; children with poor language in the current study were not slower to respond than their peers. It was their peers who were faster to respond under low load conditions. On the other hand, our study did not provide a rigorous test of a generalized slowing account for SLI either. We measured response time. Many previous studies demonstrating slower responses in SLI than typically developing groups have employed reaction time paradigms that more directly test the fastest possible response after presentation of a stimulus ([Miller et al., 2001).\n",
      "As is common in many studies of this type, the main limitation of the current study was the small sample size. One way that we attempted to combat this issue was to recruit participants with a broad range of language and working memory abilities. The resulting problem was an unbalanced design such that many more participants met criteria for typical development than language impairment or working memory impairment. To deal with this, we analyzed the data using linear mixed effects, a procedure that can accommodate both unbalanced designs and correlated observations. It could be argued that not having all participants complete the identical task with the same number of items is a limitation. Nevertheless, we had a strong rationale for adjusting task demands based on individual storage capacity. As a result, we argue that the high/low working memory load manipulation employed imposed uniformly high or low demands for all participants. Finally, the generalized measures of working memory and language included in the current study were administered up to 8 months prior to the experimental task. Given that the standardized tests employed used 12-month age bands for all ages tested and the age range of the participants (6–10years), these data were considered sufficient to capture the true individual differences in language and working memory in the sample.\n",
      "The results of this study have important clinical and educational implications. First and foremost, the findings highlight the vulnerability of working above span, especially for those with low storage capacities. Cognitive demands were additive in the current study such that attention-related and storage-related requirements affected working memory performance. Importantly, even attempts to help a child through a task may do nothing but add additional, and unachievable, demands when the child is working beyond his or her working memory storage capacity. In our study, the effort to direct attention to the important information used up precious resources and resulted in lower recall accuracy when working above span. Speed of responding to varying cognitive loads was associated with language abilities in the current study. Those with good language skills were able to respond faster when cognitive load was low. It may be that effective strategy use is facilitated by linguistic abilities and that those with poor language may benefit from direct teaching of strategies.\n",
      "The current study investigated the relationship among executive attention, working memory, and language abilities in school-age children. The ability to selectively attend to target shapes depended on whether the task was being completed above or below span. When working within available storage capacity, selective attention demands had no impact on performance, whereas when working beyond available storage capacity, there was a cost due to the inability to filter out irrelevant items and the associated effort. Another novel finding was related to the impact on response times of working beyond available short-term memory capacity. Those with high storage capacity were relatively impervious to above span demands, maintaining performance response times despite the increased load. On the other hand, high load imposed a cost on those with low storage capacity, resulting in slower responses. There was a positive overall relationship between the experimental task and a generalized working memory measure, suggesting that the impact of attention-related and storage demands are additive with no preferential access to available resources. Finally, language abilities were associated with speed of responses but not accuracy and depended on the cognitive load of the task. These findings provide only limited evidence for a domain-general mechanism in language learning.\n",

      "After Institutional Review Board approval, data were extracted from the Richard L. Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center in Indianapolis, Indiana. The data for this study were obtained from an ongoing study of first-time colonoscopy. All data extracted were in electronic format. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously selected, and the test characteristics were not explicitly outlined for this study and were applied by using custom fully electronic software as part of the parent study design.\n",
      "Inclusion criteria for the parent study cohort included all veterans aged 40 years and older who had an index outpatient colonoscopy between 2002 and 2009 for any indication.\n",
      "Exclusion criteria for the cohort included (1) previous Veterans Health Administration–based colonoscopy, (2) indication for colonoscopy of surveillance for neoplasia, (3) surgical resection of any part of the large intestine, (4) history of polyps or cancer of the colon or rectum, (5) history of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or inflammatory bowel disease, (6) history of hereditary polyposis syndrome, (7) history of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome, or (8) having a colonoscopy earlier within the 8-year sampling frame (eg, a person with 2 colonoscopies within the sampling frame would have the second excluded).\n",
      "The extracted reports were linked as part of the parent study by using study-specific software to their corresponding pathology reports and de-identified for NLP analysis. There were 10,798 reports, with 6379 linked to pathology. Five hundred of the reports with linked pathology were randomly selected by using MySQL random record selection for triplicate manual annotation.[Figure 1 shows the flow chart for the study.\n",
      "The 500 reports and their linked pathology were combined into a single text document. Each document had a unique document ID and 4 sections: findings, impression, specimen, and pathology.\n",
      "To analyze the reports, clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES), an open-source, freely available, Java-based NLP engine developed originally by the Mayo Clinic,[20] was used. It was written on top of the Unstructured Information Management Architecture framework.[21] cTAKES was designed to process clinical notes and uses named entity recognition to map identified concepts to the UMLS Metathesaurus,[22,23] a large, multipurpose, and multilingual thesaurus that contains millions of biomedical and health-related concepts, their synonymous names, and their relationships.[24] This entity recognition allows for capture of key clinical concepts to a standardized format for secondary usage (eg, UMLS CUI). cTAKES also determines if the named entity is negated as well as the context of the named entity within the document to allow for more robustness than simple text mining strategies.\n",
      "UMLS concepts were then matched against relevant terms such as “tubulovillous adenoma” for CUI C0334307. If the CUI was negated, it was excluded. These terms were searched and written to an NLP key. Sequential searching was used to identify the highest level of pathology from carcinoma to normal mucosa and included size identification to further classify the concept.\n",
      "Definitions were agreed to a priori for the terms for each concept. The highest level of pathology was divided into 5 categories: (1) carcinoma, (2) advanced adenoma, (3) nonadvanced adenoma, (4) hyperplastic polyp, and (5) normal mucosa/nonsignificant. Sessile serrated polyps were included within the adenoma category. Advanced adenomas were defined as those with villous features, carcinoma in situ, high-grade dysplasia, or adenoma with size on colonoscopy report ≥10 mm with size determined by the endoscopist. Nonsignificant findings included lipomas, benign colonic tissue, or no specimen for pathologic review.\n",
      "The location of the most advanced lesion was defined as proximal (cecum to and including splenic flexure), distal (descending colon to and including the rectum), and both proximal and distal equivalent for most advanced lesions.\n",
      "The largest adenoma removed and the total number of adenomas removed were captured. Presence and absence of hemorrhoids and diverticulosis were captured.\n",
      "Three of the authors (T.D.I., T.F.I., and C.K.) independently manually reviewed all 500 randomized documents and their associated pathology reports to determine the (1) highest level of pathology, (2) number of adenomas removed, (3) size of adenoma removed, (4) location of adenoma, and (5) presence of diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.\n",
      "Recall, precision, accuracy, and f-measure were calculated for both the testing and training data sets. Recall was defined as [true positives/(true positives + false negatives)] or (reports in agreement/positive reports by gold standard). Precision was defined as [true positives/(true positives + false positives)] or (reports in agreement/positive reports by NLP). Accuracy was defined as [(true positives + true negatives)/(true positives + false positives + true negatives + false negatives)]. The f-measure is defined as [2 * (precision * recall)/(precision + recall)] and is used for the measurement of information retrieval and measures the effectiveness of retrieval.[25] The values for recall, precision, accuracy, and f-measure vary between 0–1, with 1 being the optimal.\n",
      "One hundred fifty of the annotated samples were used for NLP training, with blinding to the other annotated documents. All 500 annotated gold standard documents were used for testing. Annotated linked colonoscopy and pathology reports were then run through the NLP engine to capture the highest level of pathology and previously defined concepts.\n",

       " 'description': 'Background & Aims\\n                  Little is known about the ability of natural language processing (NLP) to extract meaningful information from free-text gastroenterology reports for secondary use.\\n               \\n               \\n                  Methods\\n                  We randomly selected 500 linked colonoscopy and pathology reports from 10,798 nonsurveillance colonoscopies to train and test the NLP system. By using annotation by gastroenterologists as the reference standard, we assessed the accuracy of an open-source NLP engine that processed and extracted clinically relevant concepts. The primary outcome was the highest level of pathology. Secondary outcomes were location of the most advanced lesion, largest size of an adenoma removed, and number of adenomas removed.\\n               \\n               \\n                  Results\\n                  The NLP system identified the highest level of pathology with 98% accuracy, compared with triplicate annotation by gastroenterologists (the standard). Accuracy values for location, size, and number were 97%, 96%, and 84%, respectively.\\n               \\n               \\n                  Conclusions\\n                  The NLP can extract specific meaningful concepts with 98% accuracy. It might be developed as a method to further quantify specific quality metrics.',\n",
